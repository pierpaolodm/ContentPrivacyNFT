# ContentPrivacyNFT
## Description
This project aims to address the **issue** of **indiscriminate access** to **data** contained within **decentralized** platforms that regulate the **ownership** of digital assets through **Non-Fungible Tokens** (NFTs). While NFTs have been widely used for digital asset ownership, the public accessibility of the associated data poses a challenge for asset owners in certain scenarios.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a framework for publishing NFTs that maintains compliance with standards while integrating **privacy-enhancing tools** such as **zero-knowledge proofs** (ZKP). By leveraging ZKP, the framework aims to enable confidentiality of the NFT content without compromising its usability. However, the inefficiency of such tools presents a significant challenge, requiring extensive experimental work to identify practical solutions in real-world scenarios.
